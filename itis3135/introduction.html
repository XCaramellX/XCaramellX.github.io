        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Personal Background</strong>: My name is Parker Randolph, I'm 22 and I was born in Hawaii.<br>
                I've been in a military family all my life so we moved around a lot. We moved to Georgia in 2008 and then to North Carolina in 2012 and been here ever since.

            <li>
                <strong>Primary Computer Platform</strong>: My primary computer platform is my Desktop computer. I find it more comfertable to use than Laptops.

                <strong>Courses Taking and why</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>ITIS-3135 Web App Design and Development: This class looks like it would be fun and I wouldn't mind fron't end devlopment</li>
                    <li>ITCS-3134 Digital Image Processing: A required class for my degree</li>
                    <li>ITCS-3160 Database Design & Implementation: A required class for my degree</li>
                    <li>ITIS-3130 Human Centered Design: A required class for my degree and it looks pretty easy to do as of now.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>My Stories</strong>: There was one time where on campus I fell down the stairs near my dorm building.<br>
                I sprained my ankle, so it was harder to get around campus and I was happy when we got online classes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Something else about me</strong>: I haven't been on campus since 2020 because of covid-19 so most of my classes have been online. </li>
        </ul>
