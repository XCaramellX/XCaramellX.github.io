            <p>
                I, PARKER R. RANDOLPH agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SPRING SEMESTER 2022, ITIS3135,<br> WEB APP DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.<br><br>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly avalible online tools will be avalible to the world, and will not <br>put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br><br>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,<br> failure to turn in assignments may show absences.<br><br>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find my examples online or<br> even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut<br>
                and paste code except where I have properly given credit(i.e external libraries) and never from my<br> classmates.<br><br> Signed: <span class="italized">Parker R.Randolph, 22/01/2022</span>
