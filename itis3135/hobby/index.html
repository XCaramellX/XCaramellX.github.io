            Welcome to Randolph Gaming! here you will see how I got into video games, what my favoirte games are, and more!
            I got into video games at a young age and wanted to make games myself as I grew older. I realized now that making games
            are no joke and it is a difficult process. While I don't to make video games as career anymore, I do want to make some as a hobby. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I've also made some mods (modifications) to games that I have played in the past such as, Crusader Kings 2 and 3. I loved playing grand stratagy games
            and they are among some of the best games I've played.

        The DioField Chronicles. 
     </p> <br>

     <p>
        For Nintendo Directs there hasn't been much I've been looking foward too. However their are some games that look intresting in the past Nintendo Directs. Like 
        Kirby the forgotten lands and Xenoblade chronicles 3.

    <p> 
        My favorite series of games has to be kingdom hearts. Ever since I was a kid kingdom hearts with it's great story and characters had to have been the best game I've played.
        My second favorite game had to be undertale, I really like the story presented with the relationship monsters and humans. I also like that you could have diffrent endings
        to the story and the game even remebered what choices you made throught the game, even if you started a new one.

        I've never been to an esport event but there are a few I would love to go see. The first one being the League Of Legends World Championship and the 
        second being the DOTA2 2022 International. The reason I want to go is because I love being in the action.

            My name is Parker Randolph and I'm a student at the Universty of North Carolina at Charlotte the loves to play video games.
            I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, my family and I were a military family so we moved around a lot. Eventualy, after my dad's 20 years of service,
            we settled down in North Carolina.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's a smaller town where I live but after living on campus in bigger cities such as Charlotte. I think I prefer it's peacefulness and quietness over 
            the bustling city.
