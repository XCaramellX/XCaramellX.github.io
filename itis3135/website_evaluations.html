        </h3>
        <p>
            Lost Ark is a MMOARPG(Massive Multiplayer Online Action RPG) Devolped by Tripod Studio and Smilegate RPG. For North America, Amazon games is publishing it. <br>
            The site explains the game as well as the news and has a community tab.<br><br>
            CRAP Principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <li>Repetition</li>
            <li>Alignment</li>
            <li>Proximity</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            I think the site does follow the principles of CRAP because the site has contrasting black, grey and white colors.<br>
            The repetition is the same throught which makes it easier to read. While the nav bar is at the top the proximity the "BACK TO TOP" button is seen clearly.

            <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/?icid=nav_bar_logo"><strong>NBC News</strong></a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            NBC News is an American News site that primarly focuses on what's happening in America while but also does have International coverage.<br><br>
            CRAP Principles:

            <ul>
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Alignment</li>
                <li>Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <p>
            I think the site does not follow the principles of CRAP because the alignment for most of the content is off, so it makes it hard to tell what to look at first.<br>
            There is also bad contrast because alot of the words that are not in the header are bolded so it makes so that you don't know which is more important.
