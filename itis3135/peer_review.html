        <p>
            There are no spaces in the folders or file names. The site has sufficient contrast so that it is easy to read and the site is using<br>
            a external style sheet. <br><br>

        </p>

            <strong>CRAP:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Contrast: The colors contrast really well to let the person see what is going on.<br>
                It also leads the persons eye to what they need to see.</li><br>
                <li>Repetition: The h1 and h2 are all in the same place on every page. Making the the layout unconfusing.</li><br>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment for the paragraphs is a good contrast to the alignment of the tables and forms.<br>
                Forms and tables, I think it looks better and it's easier for the reader since it's in focus.</li><br>
                <li>Proximity: The proximity of the diffrent elements are good. No extra spacings or elements far off from where there supposed to be.<br>
                Like one part of the nav bar being all the way to the right.</li>
            </ol> <br>

            <strong>Website has within it:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Header: all pages have a header and the text is in an h1.</li><br>
                <li>Main: all the pages have a main and has the name of the page as an h2.</li><br>
                <li>Footer: All pages have a footer and has the html/css validation buttons.</li><br>
                <li>Nav(optional): All the pages have a nav bar.</li>
            </ol><br>

            <p>
                Overall the site is well constructed. However, there are some pages from recent assignments.<br>
                I assume they haven't updated their webpages in awhile. They also seems to have any hover effect on their 
                nav bar(i.e highlighting the letters or underline).

                <li>Alignment: The alignment for the contact and pricing and packages are good.<br>
                The package and pricing page has really good spacing, as well as the pictures have good spacing.</li><br>

            <p>
                Overall the site is really well done. However, I wish the gallary page wouldn't load one image first then the the rest of the images.
