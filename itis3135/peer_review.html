        <p>
            There are no spaces in the folders or file names. The site has sufficient contrast so that it is easy to read and the site is using<br>
            a external style sheet. <br><br>

        </p>

            <strong>CRAP:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Contrast: The colors contrast really well to let the person see what is going on.<br>
                It also leads the persons eye to what they need to see.</li><br>
                <li>Repetition: The h1 and h2 are all in the same place on every page. Making the the layout unconfusing.</li><br>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment for the paragraphs is a good contrast to the alignment of the tables and forms.<br>
                Forms and tables, I think it looks better and it's easier for the reader since it's in focus.</li><br>
                <li>Proximity: The proximity of the diffrent elements are good. No extra spacings or elements far off from where there supposed to be.<br>
                Like one part of the nav bar being all the way to the right.</li>
            </ol> <br>

            <strong>Website has within it:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Header: all pages have a header and the text is in an h1.</li><br>
                <li>Main: all the pages have a main and has the name of the page as an h2.</li><br>
                <li>Footer: All pages have a footer and has the html/css validation buttons.</li><br>
                <li>Nav(optional): All the pages have a nav bar.</li>
            </ol><br>

            <p>
                Overall the site is well constructed. However, there are some pages from recent assignments.<br>
                I assume they haven't updated their webpages in awhile. They also seems to have any hover effect on their 
                nav bar(i.e highlighting the letters or underline).

            <ol>
                <li>Contrast: The colors contrast really well to let the person see what is going on. However, some of the assignment pages(specifically the image swap and the carousel) don't have the sites css.<br>
                Making it jarring to go from one color on one page to another color on another page.<br></li><br>

            <p>
                Overall the site is really well done. However, the nav bar seems to be really cluttered and the hovering over links seems 
                to hightlight the background color, Instead of the words themselves which is just my personal opinion on it.
