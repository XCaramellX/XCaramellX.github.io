      <h2>Chess history</h2>
      <p class="p-history-info ">
          There is not alot about the origin of chess. There are however game pieces found in Russia, China, India, Central Asia, Pakistan.
          That have been determined to be older than the 6th century. They involved dice and sometimes game boards of 100 or more squares.
          <br /><br />
          One of the earlier games was a war game called <i>Chaturanga</i>, a Sanskirt name for a battle formation in the Indian epic <i>Mahabharata</i>.
          <i>Chaturanga</i> rose in popularity in northwestern India by the 7th century and it is said to be the earliest ancestor of modern chess because it had two important concepts.
          The first is that diffrent pieces had diffrent abilites and the second is that victory was decided on one piece, the King of present day chess.<br /><br />
          The rules and appearance that we see now in chess have evolved slowly and have had widespread regional variation. In the 1300s the pawn piece had gained the ability
          to move two squares on it's first turn. Pawn promotion and the Bishop piece became popular after 1475, when rule changes made it so pawns could promote into Queens and the 
          Bishop could now move all diagonal squares of it's color instead of just two.<br /><br />
