        <div id="material-count-box" class="basic-concept-container">
            <h4>Material Count</h4>
             <p class="p-basic-concept-and-openings">
                It is one of the most stright forward concepts to understand. If a player knows how to count the total Piece
                value of each player they can determine who has the material advantage.

            <h4>Piece Activity</h4>
             <p class="p-basic-concept-and-openings">
                Piece activity is more of an abstrct concept. You can be low on material but have more active pieces
                Which can make you have much more of an advantage.<br><br> For example: The image on the right shows that white
                has more pieces to threaten black's king with.

            <h4>Pawn Structure</h4>
             <p class="p-basic-concept-and-openings">
                Pawn structure is the way the pawns are placed into a specific position.
                understanding pawn structure is a must for any serious chess player becasue it affects other concepts.
                Attack planing, piece activity, and holes are all influenced by pawn structure.

            <h4>Space</h4>
             <p class="p-basic-concept-and-openings">
                It is related to the number of squares that a player can move ther pawns.
                A player could have more space queenside, kingside, center, or in all of the sections.
                <br><br>
                The figure on the right shows that White controls more sqaures than Black.
                Therefore has more freedom to move.

                It is one of the most critical concepts in chess. If you have an unsafe king 
                you could be at a losing disadvante because you might get checkmated.

            <p class="p-basic-concept-and-openings">
                Black's c5 posisition is the most popular response to White's e4 position. This defense is
                a reputable and sound opening. It is one of the oldest known openings and it's popularity
                sky rocketed in the second half of the 20th century.

                One of the most oldest openings in chess. The name comes from an 1834 game
                between the London Chess Club and the Paris Chess Club. It is a repsonse to white's e4
                by moving to e6.

            <p class="p-basic-concept-and-openings">
                This opening is also known as the Spanish Opening or Spanish Game. It is one of
                most analyzed openings in chess history. Most adopt this opening as apart of their
                repertoire. This opening starts after the moves e4 e5(pawn moves to e5 in response to e4)
                , Nf3 Nc6(knight to c6 in response to Knight to f3), and bb5(bishop goes to b5). White 
                usually fights for control of the center and Black has hard time getting an advantage in this opening.

                It is known for it's solidity and it's defining move is c6 in response to e4.
                It then goes to d5 without blocking the light-squared bishop. Which is considered
                the main drawback of it's cousin the French Defense.
