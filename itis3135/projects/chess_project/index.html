                        While the king is not the most powerful piece on the board, it is the most important. You can't capture a king, it can only be attacked.
                        If your king is being attacked it is in "check". A king can't move into check (it is an illegal move) and if a king is put into check it must get out of check.
                        If the king can not get out of check, it's checkmate! <br /><br />
                        A king can get out of checkmate if:<br /><br />

                        1. You move the king out of check <br />
                        2. block the check with another piece <br />
                        3. capture the piece putting the king in check <br /><br />

                        The queen is the most powerful of all the chess pieces because it can attack and defend more squares than the other pieces.
                        They can move in any direction like a king, can move up, down, left, right like a rook, and they can move diagonal like the bishop.

                        The bishop can move as far as it wants to but only on diagonals. It is a long ranged piece and is restrained to half of the board
                        and can only move on it's respective light or dark squares. A light squared-bishop can only move on light squares and a dark-squared bishop can move only on dark sqaures.
                        A light-sqaured bisop can not change to a dark-sqaured bishop or vise-versa.<br /><br />
