                        While the king is not the most powerful piece on the board, it is the most important. You can't capture a king, it can only be attacked.
                        If your king is being attacked it is in "check". A king can't move into check (it is an illegal move) and if a king is put into check it must get out of check.
                        If the king can not get out of check, it's checkmate! <br /><br />
                        A king can get out of checkmate if:<br /><br />

                        1. You move the king out of check <br />
                        2. block the check with another piece <br />
                        3. capture the piece putting the king in check <br /><br />

                        The queen is the most powerful of all the chess pieces because it can attack and defend more squares than the other pieces.
                        They can move in any direction like a king, can move up, down, left, right like a rook, and they can move diagonal like the bishop.

                        The bishop can move as far as it wants to but only on diagonals. It is a long ranged piece and is restrained to half of the board
                        and can only move on it's respective light or dark squares. A light squared-bishop can only move on light squares and a dark-squared bishop can move only on dark sqaures.
                        A light-sqaured bisop can not change to a dark-sqaured bishop or vise-versa.<br /><br />

                        This piece moves diffrently than other pieces, it moves multiple squares each move. They can either move vertically up or down one square and
                        horizontally over two squares, or up or virtically up or down two squares and over one squre horizontally. Their movement can be represented as an "L" shape.
                        They can also jump over pieces and can change between the colored squares.
