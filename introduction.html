                        I've been in a military family all my life so we moved around a lot. We moved to Georgia in 2008 and then to North Carolina in 2012 and been here ever since.

                            <li>ITIS-3135 Web App Design and Development: This class looks like it would be fun and I wouldn't mind fron't end devlopment</li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="bolded">My Stories</span>: There was one time where on campus I fell down the stairs near my dorm building.<br>
                        I sprained my ankle, so it was harder to get around campus and I was happy when we got online classes.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bolded">Something else about me</span>: I haven't been on campus since 2020 because of covid-19 so most of my classes have been online. </li>
