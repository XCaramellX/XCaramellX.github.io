                        Personal Background: My name is Parker Randolph, I'm 22 and I was born in Hawaii.<br>
                        I've been in a military family all my life so we moved around a lot. We moved to Georgia in 2008 and then to North Carolina in 2012 and been here ever since.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Professional Background: I don't have a professional working back ground yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Academic Background: I'm a Undergraduate at Charlotte University and I will graduate with a B.A in Computer Science.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Background in Course: I took a Software engineering class the semester before I took ITIS 3135. I learned some HTML and CSS but not much.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Primary Computer Platform: My primary computer platform is my Desktop computer. I find it more comfertable to use than Laptops.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Courses Taking and why:
                        <ul>
                            <li>ITIS-3135 Web App Design and Development: This class looks like it would be fun and I wouldn't mind fron't end devlopment</li>
                            <li>ITCS-3134 Digital Image Processing: A required class for my degree</li>
                            <li>ITCS-3160 Database Design & Implementation: A required class for my degree</li>
                            <li>ITIS-3130 Human Centered Design: A required class for my degree and it looks pretty easy to do as of now.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My Stories: There was one time where on campus I fell down the stairs near my dorm building.<br>
                        I sprained my ankle, so it was harder to get around campus and I was happy when we got online classes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Something else about me: I haven't been on campus since 2020 because of covid-19 so most of my classes have been online. </li>
